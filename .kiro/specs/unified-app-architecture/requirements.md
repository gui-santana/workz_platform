# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a unified architecture for Workz! applications that supports both JavaScript and Flutter apps with optimized storage, build pipelines, and runtime execution. The system will provide a hybrid storage approach that maintains simplicity for small apps while offering scalability and advanced features for complex applications.

## Glossary

- **Workz_Platform**: The main platform that hosts and executes applications
- **App_Builder**: The application creation and editing interface within Workz!
- **WorkzSDK**: The unified software development kit for app integration
- **Hybrid_Storage**: Storage system supporting both database and filesystem approaches
- **Build_Pipeline**: Automated compilation and deployment system for applications
- **Runtime_Engine**: The execution environment for applications within the platform
- **Storage_Threshold**: Size limit that determines storage strategy (50KB)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create simple JavaScript apps quickly, so that I can prototype and deploy basic functionality without complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates a JavaScript app under 50KB, THE Workz_Platform SHALL store the code in the database
2. WHEN the app is executed, THE Runtime_Engine SHALL load the code directly from database storage
3. THE Workz_Platform SHALL render JavaScript apps through the unified embed.html interface
4. THE WorkzSDK SHALL provide consistent API access regardless of storage method
5. WHEN the app is saved, THE Workz_Platform SHALL validate the code size against the Storage_Threshold

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create complex Flutter applications with full development features, so that I can build sophisticated multi-platform apps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates a Flutter app, THE Workz_Platform SHALL initialize a Git repository in the filesystem
2. THE Build_Pipeline SHALL compile Flutter apps to web, Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux targets
3. THE Workz_Platform SHALL store compiled artifacts in organized directory structures by platform
4. WHEN Flutter web apps execute, THE Runtime_Engine SHALL load them through the same embed.html interface as JavaScript apps
5. THE Workz_Platform SHALL provide version control capabilities through Git integration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified SDK experience, so that I can use the same APIs regardless of whether I'm building in JavaScript or Flutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE WorkzSDK SHALL provide identical functionality for both JavaScript and Flutter applications
2. WHEN a Flutter web app runs, THE WorkzSDK SHALL use JavaScript interop to access platform services
3. WHEN a Flutter native app runs, THE WorkzSDK SHALL use platform-specific bridges for iOS and Android
4. THE WorkzSDK SHALL handle authentication, storage, and API calls consistently across all platforms
5. THE Workz_Platform SHALL initialize the SDK automatically in all runtime environments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want automatic storage optimization, so that the system scales efficiently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an app exceeds the Storage_Threshold, THE Workz_Platform SHALL automatically migrate it to filesystem storage
2. THE Workz_Platform SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing database-stored apps
3. WHEN storage migration occurs, THE Workz_Platform SHALL preserve all app metadata and functionality
4. THE Workz_Platform SHALL provide transparent API access regardless of underlying storage method
5. THE Workz_Platform SHALL track storage type in the apps table for routing decisions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent build and deployment processes, so that I can focus on app logic rather than infrastructure concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Build_Pipeline SHALL support both JavaScript and Flutter apps through unified interfaces
2. WHEN a build is triggered, THE Build_Pipeline SHALL compile apps to appropriate target platforms
3. THE Build_Pipeline SHALL store artifacts in standardized directory structures
4. WHEN builds complete, THE Workz_Platform SHALL update app status and provide download URLs
5. THE Build_Pipeline SHALL handle dependencies automatically for both JavaScript and Flutter projects

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want advanced development features for complex apps, so that I can collaborate and maintain code effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE an app uses filesystem storage, THE Workz_Platform SHALL provide Git version control
2. THE Workz_Platform SHALL support branching and tagging for filesystem-stored apps
3. THE App_Builder SHALL provide diff visualization for code changes
4. THE Workz_Platform SHALL enable collaborative development through Git workflows
5. THE Workz_Platform SHALL maintain audit trails for all code modifications

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want efficient resource utilization, so that the system performs well under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Runtime_Engine SHALL cache compiled artifacts to minimize build times
2. THE Workz_Platform SHALL serve static assets efficiently for both storage types
3. WHEN apps are requested, THE Runtime_Engine SHALL load only necessary code and assets
4. THE Workz_Platform SHALL implement lazy loading for large applications
5. THE Build_Pipeline SHALL support incremental builds to reduce compilation time

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless migration between storage types, so that I can upgrade my apps without losing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer requests migration, THE Workz_Platform SHALL convert between database and filesystem storage
2. THE Workz_Platform SHALL preserve all app versions during migration
3. WHEN migration completes, THE Workz_Platform SHALL update routing to use the new storage method
4. THE Workz_Platform SHALL provide rollback capabilities if migration fails
5. THE App_Builder SHALL indicate current storage type and migration options to developers
